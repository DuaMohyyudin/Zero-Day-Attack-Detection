Zero-Day Attack Detection


Overview:

This repository contains the implementation of my Final Year Project (FYP) titled "AI-Driven Zero-Day Attack Detection." The project focuses on leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect previously unknown (zero-day) vulnerabilities in network traffic, helping to identify potential threats before they are exploited.

Goals:

The primary objectives of this project are:

Early Detection of Zero-Day Attacks: Develop AI models to identify previously unseen threats in network traffic.
Accurate Classification: Use machine learning models to distinguish between normal and malicious traffic.
Feature Analysis: Identify and evaluate significant features in network traffic that contribute to zero-day attack detection.
Real-Time Analysis: Enable users to upload datasets and evaluate attack detection models in real-time.
Visualization of Results: Provide visual representations of attack detection performance and metrics.
Model Evaluation: Compare different AI and machine learning techniques to determine the most effective approach for zero-day attack detection.

Features:

AI and ML Techniques: Implements machine learning and deep learning algorithms for attack detection.
Custom Datasets: Allows users to upload their own datasets for model training and evaluation.
Model Comparison: Compares multiple detection models for accuracy and performance.
Real-Time Detection: Provides instant feedback on the detection of zero-day attacks in network traffic.
